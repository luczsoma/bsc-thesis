I would like to thank my supervisors Dávid Honfi and Gábor Szárnyas for their friendly advice and enthusiasm, and for being available and fully responsive at any time.

I would like to thank Dániel Stein for creating and documenting the foundations of my research, and for providing guidance and continuous support for the Codemodel-Rifle framework. I would also wish to express my gratitude to Ádám Lippai for his numerous valuable suggestions, and for making the \lstinline{webclient} proprietary software of Tresorit available for analysis. I would also like to thank András Vörös, Kristóf Marussy, Oszkár Semeráth, and other members of the Fault Tolerant Systems Research Group for providing assistance during writing this thesis.

Last but not least, I am deeply grateful to my family and friends for their continuous support and understanding.
